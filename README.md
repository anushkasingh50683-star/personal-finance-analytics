# expense-tracker-analysis
This project is a Python-based personal expense tracker and analysis system.
It is being developed incrementally to understand real-world data handling,
analysis, and problem-solving using Python.

## Why this project?
Most beginner projects stop at taking input and printing output.
This project focuses on:
- managing real-world data
- improving code structure over time
- learning data analysis concepts through practice

## Current Features
- Add daily expenses with date, category, description, and amount
- View all recorded expenses
- Calculate total expenses

## Current Limitations
- Data is stored in memory and is lost after program exit
- No validation for date or category
- No expense analysis by category or time

## Planned Improvements
- Save and load expenses from a file
- Improve input validation
- Modularize code using functions
- Category-wise and time-based expense analysis
- Basic data visualization (later stage)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Standard Python libraries

## Status
🚧 Work in progress — this project is being actively improved.
